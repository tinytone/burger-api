# Burger-api

This is a repository containing a burger-api hosted using node

This inspiration for this project is from Ania Kobow's youtube video:

[Make your own mock API (super simple)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLnxgSZ0DG4)

Her github repo for the video is [here](https://github.com/kubowania/burger-api).

Ania then deployed her Burger API to Heroku, so the live version of her API can be found here: 
https://my-burger-api.herokuapp.com/burgers

# Steps in Video

## Create a new repo on github

- Click the new button on your github repo: https://github.com/new
- Enter a Repository name e.g. **burger-api**
- Make it public
- Add a README.MD file
- Add a .gitignore file selecting the **node** from the dropdown

## Cloning the Repo

- On your local machine, open up a new powershell window in your "source code" folder
- Clone the repo to your local machine using git:

```powershell
PS C:\SourceCode\GitHub> git clone https://github.com/tinytone/burger-api.git

Cloning into 'burger-api'...
remote: Enumerating objects: 4, done.
remote: Counting objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Compressing objects: 100% (4/4), done.
remote: Total 4 (delta 0), reused 0 (delta 0), pack-reused 0
Receiving objects: 100% (4/4), done.
```

## Opening the Code

Open up the Code in Visual Code by using:

```powershell
PS C:\SourceCode\GitHub> code .
```

## Creating the Database

Create a file called **db.json** in your project.

> The burger data for the new json file was copy and pasted from Ania's [db.json](https://github.com/kubowania/burger-api/blob/main/db.json) on her github repo.

```json
{
    "burgers": [
      {
        "id": 0,
        "name": "Tribute Burger",
        "restaurant": "Honest Burgers",
        "web": "www.honestburgers.co.uk",
        "description": "A mouth-watering honest beef burger",
        "ingredients": [
          "beef",
          "american cheese",
          "burger sauce",
          "french mustard",
          "pickes",
          "onion",
          "lettuce"
        ],
        "addresses": [
          {
            "addressId": 0,
            "number": "75",
            "line1": "Venn Street",
            "line2": "Clapham",
            "postcode": "SW4 0BD",
            "country": "United Kingdom"
          }
        ]
      },
      { 
          // etc
      }
    ]
}
```

## Installing NPM Packages

Ensure that you have both **node.js** and **npm** installed. Node.js can be downloaded from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) which will also install npm.

Verifying versions:

```powershell
PS C:\SourceCode\GitHub\burger-api> node -v
v14.17.5

PS C:\SourceCode\GitHub\burger-api> npm -v
6.14.14
```

Using ```npm```, download and install the ```json-server``` package as follows

```
npm install -g json-server
```

E.g.

```
PS C:\SourceCode\GitHub\burger-api> npm install -g json-server
C:\Users\{your user}\AppData\Roaming\npm\json-server -> C:\Users\{your user}\AppData\Roaming\npm\node_modules\json-server\lib\cli\bin.js
+ json-server@0.17.0
added 173 packages from 80 contributors in 9.275s
```
## Starting the Json Server using json-server


Start the json server, pointing it at our burger database json file, as follows:

```
json-server --watch db.json
```

E.g.

```powershell
PS C:\SourceCode\GitHub\burger-api> json-server --watch db.json

  \{^_^}/ hi!

  Loading db.json
  Done

  Resources
  http://localhost:3000/burgers

  Home
  http://localhost:3000

  Type s + enter at any time to create a snapshot of the database
  Watching...
```

We can now browse to http://localhost:3000/burgers to view all burgers or http://localhost:3000/burgers/1 to view specific burgers!

At this point we're done! We've created an api reading a database with 2 commands! 
- npm install -g json-server
- json-server --watch db.json

Note:

The [db.json](https://github.com/tinytone/burger-api/blob/master/db.json) file has a burgers top level node. This is the "root" URL that json-server uses. Additional routes can be added by further modifying this json file:

```
{
    "burgers": []
} 
```

## Initialising our project

Time to initialise our project using 

```
npm init
```

This will ask you a series of questions which will then be added to a newly created [package.json](https://github.com/tinytone/burger-api/blob/master/package.json) file:

```powershell
PS C:\SourceCode\GitHub\burger-api> npm init

This utility will walk you through creating a package.json file.
It only covers the most common items, and tries to guess sensible defaults.

See `npm help init` for definitive documentation on these fields
and exactly what they do.

Use `npm install <pkg>` afterwards to install a package and
save it as a dependency in the package.json file.

Press ^C at any time to quit.

PS C:\SourceCode\GitHub\burger-api>

Add a ```package-lock.json``` file by typing:

```
npm i
```

E.g.

```powershell
PS C:\SourceCode\GitHub\burger-api> npm i

npm notice created a lockfile as package-lock.json. You should commit this file.

```

Our [package.json](https://github.com/tinytone/burger-api/blob/master/package.json) file doesn't contain details about the json-server package that we initially installed, so lets run the command again to ensure that it's correctly added to the [package.json](https://github.com/tinytone/burger-api/blob/master/package.json) file:

```powershell
PS C:\SourceCode\GitHub\burger-api> npm i json-server
+ json-server@0.17.0
added 173 packages from 80 contributors and audited 173 packages in 6.807s

13 packages are looking for funding
  run `npm fund` for details

found 0 vulnerabilities

PS C:\SourceCode\GitHub\burger-api>
```

This has now updated this file and added in the dependencies data:

```json
{
  ...
  "homepage": "https://github.com/tinytone/burger-api#readme",
  "dependencies": {
    "json-server": "^0.17.0"
  }
}
```

## Adding a start script

Edit the [package.json](https://github.com/tinytone/burger-api/blob/master/package.json) file and add a "start" script, which starts the server.js file using node, as follows:

```json
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1",
    "start": "node server.js"
  },
```

## Creating a server javascript file

Create a new [server.js]((https://github.com/tinytone/burger-api/blob/master/server.js)) file with the following contents:

```js
const jsonServer = require('json-server');
const server = jsonServer.create();
const router = jsonServer.router('db.json');
const middlewares = jsonServer.defaults();
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

server.use(middlewares);
server.use(router);

server.listen(port);
```

Using our new start script, run the server using ```npm start```

E.g

```powershell
PS C:\SourceCode\GitHub\burger-api> npm start

> burger-api@1.0.0 start C:\SourceCode\GitHub\burger-api
> node server.js

GET /db 200 2.045 ms - -
GET /__rules 404 2.438 ms - 2
GET /burgers 304 25.011 ms - -
```

You can now browse to the server at the following URL: http://localhost:3000/

You can also browse to burgers at: http://localhost:3000/burgers

# Ania's Notes:


>My Burger Api
>
>Hello everyone! In this weeks video I show you how to make your own mock version of an API and deploy it onto the internet in just a few easy steps. This is a super stripped down version, so has no routing/controllers. This is thanks to the https://github.com/typicode/json-serverâ€‹ package. Where you can get a mock REST API with zero coding in less than 30 seconds.
>
>For those of you wishing to check it out live visit here
>
>A lot of you are wondering if you can interact with this database. Yes you can. You can make GET, POST, PUT, DELETE etc requests to it. You can even get an individual burger. For example if I want to get the Tribute Burger, which has an ID of 0, I would write:
>

```
fetch('https://my-burger-api.herokuapp.com/burgers/0')
  .then(response => response.json())
  .then(data => console.log(data));
```
